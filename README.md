# Dynamic Portfolio Project

## Introduction

This is a dynamic portfolio website built with ReactJS. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences. The website is completely responsive and allows users to add information directly to a JSON file, from which data will be updated at all centers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installing and Running

1. Clone the repo git clone

2. Install NPM packages
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

To update the portfolio with your information, simply update the `resumedata.js` file in the `src` directory.

The website will automatically update to reflect the changes in the `data.json` file.
